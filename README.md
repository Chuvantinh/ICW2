Research Product Quantization to optimize the time of all algorithmen.

This method will divide the big dataset to subspace. Eg: 100 dimension into 5 times 20 Dimension
 In this project I'm using the library pqkmeans to train e dataset to small dataset.
 
Result is then time of processing PQKmean very short in the comparison with Kmeans
